# Electric Vehical Database
![car](https://github.com/Bakar31/Web-Scraping/blob/master/Electric%20Vehical/electronics%20vehicles.jpg)


In this project I scrape all information about each vehical in this website.
The key features are:

1. Name
2. Acceleration
3. Top Speed
4. Range
5. Weight
6. Efficiency
7. Number of Seats

I used BeautifulSoup and requests libraries for this project.
All the outputs are converted to into a csv file for easy use.
